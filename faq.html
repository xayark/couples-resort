            <span>Is Tipping Required?</span>
            <br/><span id="content">We are an All-Inclusive Reswort, so Tipping is in the Prices. We wish that you would rather indulge in another Spa appointment, participate in one more sport activity, have another delicious bottle of wine, spoil oneself with extending the stay another night, come back again during the next year, or tell a friend(s) about us.....any of these will help all of the Resort's working team (many of the Team have been here 10 to 30 years), far more than tipping would. This Policy insures that we can provide better quality service throughout the Resort for years to come, thank you.</span>

            <span>Do you accept Pets?</span>
            <br/><span id="content">We do not accept pets of any kind. However ask your Doctor for a "Certificate for a Therapy Pet" and then you can take and do what you wish in Ontario with your Pet, I understand many Doctors provide them easily.   The Adventure Lodge www.AdventureLodge.com which is about 4 km away from us, accepts pets. Adventure Lodge prices also include Dinner and Breakfast and we recommend them for an Authentic Canadian Experience,,,,Rustic 0-Star, yet Luxurious!</span>

            <span>Where are the moose?</span>
            <br/><span id="content">Algonquin Park has thousands of moose. The best chance of spotting a moose is along the highway 60 corridor running through Algonquin. The moose are not generally afraid of tourists, and will continue to eat along side the road. (DO NOT APPROACH A MOOSE!) Moose are most frequent through May and June when road salt from the winters roads wash into the neighbouring ditches. Moose consider salt to be a treat, especially when mixed with their greens. In the foliage months, taking a very early hike on the Mizzy Lake Trail also can be rewarding. Moose become rare to see in the winter months.</span>

          <div id="thermal-salt-water">
            <span>Why Thermal salt-water pool?</span>
            <br/><span id="content">Purely for enjoyment; we want everyone to use it. The Thermal Pool uses the Sun to heat it and they both use an electro-plate to break basic table salt into the compounds used to kill bacteria, similar to chlorine, without any of the side effects. There is no smell, it tastes a little salty and is more like a saline solution, so you can open your eyes under water and it will not irritate them. There is no chemical reaction to the skin, hair or swimsuits. You will actually feel smoother after your shower.</span>
